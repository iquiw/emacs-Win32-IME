	* erc-speak.el: see changelog

	* erc-fill.el: see erc.el changelog

	  related bugs should be gone.
	  Use (erc-track-modified-channels-minor-mode t) now to toggle this functionality.
	  Don't set the erc-track-modified-channels-minor-mode variable yourself, use the toggle function

	* erc-server-305-or-306 and erc-server-311-or-314

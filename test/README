This directory contains files intended to test various aspects of
Emacs's functionality.  Please help add tests!

See the file file-organization.org for the details of the directory
structure and file-naming conventions.

Emacs uses ERT, Emacs Lisp Regression Testing, for testing.  See (info
"(ert)") or https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/
for more information on writing and running tests.

The Makefile in this directory supports the following targets:

* make check
  Run all tests as defined in the directory.  Expensive tests are
  suppressed.  The result of the tests for <filename>.el is stored in
  <filename>.log.

* make check-maybe
  Like "make check", but run only the tests for files which have
  unresolved prerequisites.

* make check-expensive
  Like "make check", but run also the tests marked as expensive.

* make <filename>  or  make <filename>.log
  Run all tests declared in <filename>.el.  This includes expensive
  tests.  In the former case the output is shown on the terminal, in
  the latter case the output is written to <filename>.log.

ERT offers selectors, which make it possible to filter out which test
cases shall run.  The make variable $(SELECTOR) gives you a simple
mean to use your own selectors.  The ERT manual describes how
selectors are constructed, see (info "(ert)Test Selectors") or
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/Test-Selectors.html

You could use predefined selectors of the Makefile.  "make <filename>
SELECTOR='$(SELECTOR_DEFAULT)'" runs all tests for <filename>.el
except the tests tagged as expensive.

If your test file contains the tests "test-foo", "test2-foo" and
"test-foo-remote", and you want to run only the former two tests, you
could use a selector regexp (note that the "$" needs to be doubled to
protect against "make" variable expansion):

    make <filename> SELECTOR='"foo$$"'

Note that although the test files are always compiled (unless they set
no-byte-compile), the source files will be run by default, to give
nicer backtraces.  To run the compiled version of a test use

    make TEST_LOAD_EL=no ...

The tests are run in batch mode by default; sometimes it's useful to
get precisely the same environment but run in interactive mode for
debugging.  To do that, use

    make TEST_INTERACTIVE=yes ...

Some of the tests require a remote temporary directory
(filenotify-tests.el, shadowfile-tests.el and tramp-tests.el).  Per
default, a mock-up connection method is used (this might not be
possible when running on MS Windows).  If you want to test a real
remote connection, set $REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY to a suitable
value in order to overwrite the default value:

  env REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY=/ssh:host:/tmp make ...
